# 1-or-2
A shortcut I made for Apple devices that asks you 1 or 2

Use the link above to add to your Apple device.

This requires a focus to work correctly. Name it "1 or 2" and make it point to a page full of the settings app. This WILL take over the current lock and home screen wallpaper and page combo, so make a new one to prevent this. Make the wallpaper really dark with a small amount of pattern for maximum effect.

Updates will be posted to this file with a new link, so check regularly.
